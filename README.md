In this project I have demonstrated my current skills in both HTML and CSS by creating, styling, and connecting three different recipe pages. 

In doing this I have made one small web-based cookbook.

Within the cookbook should be a page for a main dish, one side, and one dessert. All capable of being reached through my index and viewed in their attached images.
