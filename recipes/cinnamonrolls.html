                    <li> 5/8 teaspoon salt
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Prepare the yeast dough. once it has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and gentely flatten and stretch it into a rectangle.
               
                <li> Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into an even larger rectangle. Approximately 12 <sup>in</sup> wide by 20 <sup>in</sup> long. Adding flour as needed, to prevent sticking.
                
                <li> Spread the softened butter over the dough, leaving a 1 <sup>in</sup> strip along the edge furthest away from you clean.
                
                <li> Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar very generously over the butter, still leaving that dry strip along the edge.
                
                <li> Starting at the edge closest to you slowly begin to tug the lip of the dough up and over the filling. Work from one side to the other, keeping it tight.
                
                <li> Once you reach the far edge, moisten it with either egg wash or water and pinch to seal the seam.
                
                <li> Use  a serrated knife (or for an even smoother cut, a length of unwaxed dental floss!) to cut the dough into even-sized pieces.
                
                <li> Place the rolls onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet around 2-3 <sup>in</sup> apart.
                
                <li> Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let them rise until they are nearly double in size.
                
                <li> Once they have risen to size, bake the rolls in a preheated 375 degrees F oven. 
                
                <li> After 30 min of baking, test for doneness by pulling up the center most roll to check if it is still sticky and raw-looking. 
                
                <li> Cool pan on a cooling rack for about 10 min before adding the icing.
            </ol>
